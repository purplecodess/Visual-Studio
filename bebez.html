		<b>To My Dearest Wifey To Be And My Beloved Girlfriend,</b><br>
	
		Happy birthday, my love ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’–. Today I get to celebrate not just the day you were born,
		but the beautiful soul that you are, someone who fills my life with joy, warmth, and so much love.
		Watching you grow and shine in everything you do is one of my greatest joys. 
		On this special day, I hope you know how cherished and adored you are, not just today, but every single day. 
		You make my world brighter with your smile, and I can't imagine a life without you in it.<br>
		
		<p></p>

		And as if today wasnâ€™t special enough, we also get to celebrate our two-year anniversary.ðŸ’• Two incredible years of laughter, 
		adventures, late-night talks, and a love that grows deeper every single day. 
		From our first moments together, to the countless memories we've shared since, youâ€™ve become my confidant, 
		my greatest supporter, and the person who holds my heart.<br>

		<p></p>

		Looking back, I see how far weâ€™ve come together, and looking forward, I see nothing but endless possibilities with you by my side. 
		Youâ€™ve made every day feel like an adventure, and Iâ€™m so grateful for every moment weâ€™ve shared and every lesson weâ€™ve learned. 
		Hereâ€™s to the love we've built, the memories weâ€™ve created, and the countless adventures that still lie ahead.<br>
		
		<p></p>

		Thank you for being you for loving me in your own unique and beautiful way. 
		Here's to many more birthdays, anniversaries, and milestones to come. 
		I canâ€™t wait to celebrate them all with you.<br>
		
		<p></p>

		Wishing you a birthday as beautiful as your heart and an anniversary filled with endless love.<br>

		<p></p>

		With all my heart, forever and always,<br>
		
		<p></p>
